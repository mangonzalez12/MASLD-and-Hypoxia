# Mechanistic Pathology (MechPath) a focus on MASLD-and-Hypoxia
Liver disease and hypoxia in Hepatic Stellate Cells

Manuscript “Enhanced relevance of hypoxia-induced in vitro models in mimicking liver fibrosis pathways”.

Liver disease in particular fibrosis has only to our knowledge only one FDA-approved drug (Resmetirom), which highlights the necessity to improve the drug discovery process in preclinical cell culture models. In addition, preclinical cell culture models (e.g. primary hepatic stellate cells) only partially recapitulate biological complexity and human in vivo disease representation. Therefore, current cell culture protocols to induce disease in vitro need further improvement. Here, we hypothesized that Hypoxia signaling is needed to complement fibrosis pathology. To test fibrosis markers on gene/protein level, we used hypoxia-mimicking compounds (DMOG/IOX2) alongside TGFB1 stimulation. Our focus was to expand mechanistic insight of the pathology as well as further mimic more closely human in vivo disease representation. 

Here, we screened two hypoxia-mimicking compounds in different doses of non-toxic concentrations in primary hepatic stellate cells. Furthermore, our HSC model showed that stimulation with IOX2 (0.3 and 1 µM) in the presence of TGFβ1 significantly increased fibrotic marker levels (total collagen, TIMP-1, and fibronectin). DMOG showed no effect using low, non-toxic concentrations. Biological functionality from differentially expressed genes (DEGs) highlighted various fibrosis-related pathways, hypoxia-related genes and crosslinking protein markers when IOX2 was added in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, comparative analysis with human DEGs (Fibrotic vs non-fibrotic) showed improved disease representation in our HSC model with IOX2 addition.

In summary, Hypoxia-mimicking compounds like IOX2 hold promise for enhancing fibrosis in in vitro models, providing valuable insights into fibrosis pathogenesis, hypoxia-related genes and potential therapeutic strategies.
